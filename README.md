Sample Java EE Application
==========================

This is a test bed application where I put in as many Java EE technologies as possible.  I will try to limit the external runtime dependencies short of JSF/HTML/CSS add-ons.

The target will be WebSphere Classic 9.0 (for Production) and WebSphere Liberty (for Eclipse debugging).

The focus is practicality rather than "artistic elegance" for this project.  So there will likely be some hacky stuff in order to make things work for the WebSphere Application Server Classic.
