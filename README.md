Sample Java EE Application
==========================

This is a test bed application where I put in as many Java EE technologies as possible.  I will try to limit the external runtime dependencies short of JSF/HTML/CSS add-ons.

The target will be WebSphere 9.0 (for Production) and WebSphere Liberty (for Eclipse debugging).
